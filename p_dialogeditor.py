# Program's core :
# Ideas for the interface :
#       - Put a check label near the answers, that will say to the program if this answer put an end at the dialog or not,
#   if it is the vector of the answer will be equal to null.
#		- Make a Method to save an unfinished dialog but make sure that the exported file can't be use by the game because 
#	it can create some errors if the object is not finished. So save the file as a different object that it can't be read by the game.
